 * Abstract base class for connectors that integrate with asynchronous message queue (AsyncMQ) systems.

 * This class extends {@link ZanixConnector} and serves as a specialized foundation
 * for implementing connectors to message brokers such as RabbitMQ, Kafka, MQTT, etc.
 *
 * It inherits the connection lifecycle management logic from `ZanixConnector`, including
 * safe connection handling and support for lazy initialization.
 *
 * Extend this class to create a custom AsyncMQ connector tailored to your messaging infrastructure.
